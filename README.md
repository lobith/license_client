Adding
------

Use the following in your cmake file:
```cmake
option(FOLEYS_LICENSING_BUILD_EXAMPLES "Build and run the tests." OFF)
option(FOLEYS_LICENSING_BUILD_EXAMPLES "Build the examples." OFF)

FetchContent_Declare(license
        GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/ffAudio/foleys_license_client.git
        GIT_TAG main
        GIT_SHALLOW ON)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(license)

Once you created a product in the website you also create a Version there, which has it's own unique key pair to talk to the server.
Also the version number will show up in the usage statistics.
